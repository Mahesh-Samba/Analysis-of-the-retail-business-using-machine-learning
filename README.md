In my retail sales prediction project, I developed a machine learning model using various techniques to forecast store sales. The dataset included independent factors such as weekends, state holidays, school holidays, weekdays, and festive seasons. I employed multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression and incorporated regularization techniques like Lasso regression to enhance model performance.

The project began with extensive feature engineering to transform and select relevant features for predicting sales. Outliers were identified and treated using box plots, ensuring data integrity and model robustness. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was crucial to understand data distributions, correlations between variables, and seasonal trends which impact sales.

Beyond traditional regression methods, I explored advanced models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks ,  time series forecasting, and Decision Trees. These models were chosen to capture complex relationships and patterns within the sales data, providing more accurate predictions.

Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared were used to assess model performance across different techniques. Cross-validation techniques were employed to validate the models' ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, time series analysis techniques were applied to understand temporal patterns in sales data and make future sales predictions based on historical trends.

Overall, this project demonstrated the application of machine learning in retail analytics, leveraging diverse models and techniques to forecast sales effectively. The insights gained can inform business strategies, inventory management, and marketing campaigns, ultimately optimizing business operations and maximizing profitability in the retail sector.
